Welcome to my [dotfiles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles) repository for my [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) instance. Feel free to have a look and/or copy some settings.

If you're new to Dotfiles, have a look at [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage your Dotfiles with a remote repository (e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)).
